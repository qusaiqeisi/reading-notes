>HTML pages are text documents.
X HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
X Tags are often referred to as elements.
X Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
X Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
X Attributes require a name and a value.
X To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go

## Extra Markup
>DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
X You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
X The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
X <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
X Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.
X The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
X The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.

## HTML5 Layout
Headers & Footers
<header> <footer>
> where we writ the main titel and the referance of te page like the claoseing and copy right .

* The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.

* A header or footer for an
individual <article> or
<section> within the page.


The sectioning elements in HTML5 are <nav>, <aside>, <article>, and <section>. <body> is also kind of a sectioning element since all content lying inside of it is part of the default document section.

Here is a brief explanation of each sectioning element and how they are used:

* <nav> – Equivalent to role="navigation". Major site navigation that consistently appears frequently across the site. Examples include the primary navigation, secondary navigation, and in-page navigation.

* <aside> – Equivalent to role="complementary". Content that is only tangentially related (or not related) to the main content. Think of something like a sidebar with supplementary information, a note within an article, or the outer container for a list of related articles at the bottom of a blog post.

* <article> – Equivalent to role="article". Content that is self-contained in that it makes sense on its own when taken out of context. That could mean a widget, a blog post or even a comment within a blog post.

* <section> – Equivalent to role="region". Content that needs extra context from its parent sectioning element to make sense. This is a generic sectioning element that is used whenever it doesn’t make sense to use the other more semantic ones

## Process & Design
> when we design page we have to make the study about the user age.background . education and intrest then we can have the page that can fit the use

**sitmap**
![sitmap](https://blog.phaisarn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/slickmap-css-sitemap.jpg)
> allow you to understand te page and its purpuse .The aim is to create a diagram
of the pages that will be used
to structure the site. This is
known as a site map and it will
show how those pages can be
grouped.
To help you decide what
information should go on each
page, you can use a technique
called card sorting.


**WireFrames**
![WireFrames](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Profilewireframe.png)

> A lot of designers will take the
elements that need to appear on
each page and start by creating
wireframes. This involves
sketching or shading areas
where each element of the page
will go (such as the logo, primary
navigation, headings and main
bodies of text, user logins etc).
By creating a wireframe you can
ensure that all of the information
that needs to be on a page is
included.


**short note **

|  tag | Element content | 	End tag |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| <h1>  | My First Heading     | </h1>   |
| <p>     | My First paragraph   | </p>      |
| <br>   | non   | non      |
| <img   | image      |
| <a>     | link   | </a>      |



## The ABC of Programming
> A B C
 

#### waht is A?
>A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 

#### waht is B?
> computer use code to fit the opject and the event .so it use html for the structercode and applie it to see it as phiscal opject.
and use the cade to make it interactive wit the user to sow him as example "welcome to my page"


#### how do i use C?
> It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.
The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).
If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.
