# Node.js
> Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

>The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

##  JavaScript runtime
> refers to where your javascript code is executed when you run it. That said, javascript can be executed on google chrome, in which case your javascript runtime is v8, if on mozilla - it is spidermonkey, if IE - then its chakra and if on node, again its v8.

## npm
> The free npm Registry has become the center of JavaScript code sharing, and with more than one million packages, the largest software registry in the world. 

### nods.js -V
>v12.22.1


### npm -V
>6.14.12

### installing jshint
> You can install jshint locally with npm install jshint or globally with npm install -g jshint . If your jshint module is in a different location, use the jshint. nodePath setting to specify the correct path. The jshint.

## pir programm 
> 1. Social skills
Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities. Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills. When just grabbing the keyboard and taking over isn’t an option, getting good at finding the right words is a skill unto itself.

> 2. Job interview readiness

 the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills

 > 3. Work environment readiness
Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.

 > 4. Engaged collaboration
When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work. Popping open your Facebook timeline is just that less enticing when someone else is looking at your scre.

> 5. Greater efficiency
It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient. In reality, when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making

> 6. Learning from fellow students
the developers in a pairing have different skill sets. If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area. The less experienced developer benefits from the experienced developer’s knowledge and guidance, and the latter benefits from explaining the topic in their own words, further solidifying their own understanding.

### pir programm help 
> Fewer mistakes and bugs. Software developers usually work alone, which can cause negative traits like stubbornness and tunnel vision. ...
Greater resiliency. The “bus factor” should be a concern for all mature software development teams. ...
Increased code quality. ...
Faster training. ...
Improved team morale.
