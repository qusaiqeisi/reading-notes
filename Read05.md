# Operators and Loops
**function , method & object**
> A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the outpu
> JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition
> An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects
   


   ## evaluating conditions & conditional satamant .
    1. evaluating conditions : which is return value  
    2. conditional satamant : which is return     

| Operator | Comparisons | Description |
| :---         |     :---:      |      
| Equal (==)   | 	x == y    | Returns true if the operands are equal.   |
|Strict equal (===)    | x === y       | Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type.     |
| Not equal (!=)   | x != y     | Returns true if the operands are not equal.   |
| Strict not equal (!==)   | 	x !== y       | Returns true if the operands are not equal and/or not of the same type.
      |
| Greater than (>)  |x>ys     |Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.    |
| Greater than or equal (>=)    | x>=y       | Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
      |
|Less than (<)   | 	x<y     | Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.    |
| Less than or equal (<=)   | x<=y       | Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
