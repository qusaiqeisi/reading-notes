# Review, Research, and Discussion 

1. What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
> In a PUT request, the enclosed entity is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version be replaced.

>With PATCH, however, the enclosed entity contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the origin server should be modified to produce a new version.

2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server ? 
> 1.Nock

*Nock is an HTTPS library designed to replicate and mock servers and expectations in Node.js. Functionally, Nock does this by overriding both the http.request and http.ClientRequest functions, intercepting requests and responding with a specific mocked response through the use of Interceptors*


## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

> 2.MockServer

[MockServer](http://www.mock-server.com/)
*MockServer (and its counterpart service MockServer Proxy) is a multifaceted tool that comes in a variety of builds. It’s available as a Netty web server, a Docker container, a Maven plugin, an npm plugin, and a Grunt plugin.*

> 3.Beeceptor

[Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/
)
Beeceptor is a great tool largely because it requires absolutely no code in order to utilize it. Beeceptor is a free online tool for mocking a REST API interaction using any HTTP request. You can customize your responses to simulate pretty much any response or failure situation. 



## Document the following Vocabulary Terms Term


1. Web Server => a computer that runs websites. It's a computer program that distributes web pages as they are requisitioned. The basic objective of the web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to the users. This intercommunication is done using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

 2. Express => a web framework that let's you structure a web application to handle multiple different http requests at a specific url
