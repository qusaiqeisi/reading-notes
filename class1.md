# Component-Based Architecture

![](https://files.speakerdeck.com/presentations/3b1c5a30fc224cacb95c0884cca1c6ed/slide_18.jpg)
### What is a component?
> A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

### What are the charactistics of a component?
> Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

> Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

> Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

> Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

>Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

> Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.


### What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
> * Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

> * Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

> * Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

> * Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

> * Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

> * Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

> * System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

> * Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.



# Props .

> “Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

* How are props used in React?
> * Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
Finally, render the Props Data
In my previous article, I’ve shown how to create & call a React component inside another component. So in this example, we have a ParentComponent including another component (child).

* What is the flow of props?
