## The JavaScript Call Stack
> A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function .

### call 
> The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.The call() allows for a function/method belonging to one object to be assigned and called for a different object. call() provides a new value of this to the function/method. With call() , you can write a method once and then inherit it in another object, without having to rewrite the method for the new object.

## LIFO
> Last in, first out (LIFO) is a method used to account for inventory. · Under LIFO, the costs of the most recent products purchased (or produced) are the first to be expensed.
Suppose there's a company called One Cup, Inc. that buys coffee mugs from wholesalers and sells them on the Internet. One Cup's cost of goods sold (COGS) differs when it uses LIFO versus when it uses FIFO. In the first scenario, the price of wholesale mugs is rising from 2016 to 2019.

## Stack Overflow
>The most-common cause of stack overflow is excessively deep or infinite recursion, in which a function calls itself so many times that the space needed to store the variables and information associated with each call is more than can fit on the stack.

## refrence error
> The #REF! error shows when a formula refers to a cell that's not valid . This happens most often when cells that were referenced by formulas get deleted, or pasted over.

## Syntax errors
> Syntax errors are mistakes in using the language. Examples of syntax errors are missing a comma or a quotation mark, or misspelling a word. MATLAB itself will flag syntax errors and give an error message.

## range error 
> A RangeError is thrown when trying to pass a number as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes that number. This can be encountered when to create an array of an illegal length with the Array constructor, or when passing bad values to the numeric methods Number.


## TypeError
>The TypeError object represents an error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type. A TypeError may be thrown when: an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function.

## Breakpoints
>  Breakpoints are markers that a programmer can place in their code to stop the code from continuing beyond points that the developer is investigating. In this article, you will use a debugger to debug some sample Node. js applications. You will first debug code using the built-in Node.

## debugger
>A debugger is a software tool that can help the software development process by identifying coding errors at various stages of the operating system or application development. Some debuggers will analyze a test run to see what lines of code were not executed.Debugging means to run your code step by step in a debugging tool like Visual Studio, to find the exact point where you made a programming mistake. You then understand what corrections you need to make in your code, and debugging tools often allow you to make temporary changes so you can continue running the program.
