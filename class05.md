 **Three Rules for Creating Images**
 1. Save images in the right format.
 2. Save images at the right size.
 3. Use the correct resolution .
  
  **tools to edit images**

  ### so what we learn .
  1.You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format
 
  2.Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
 
  3.You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image
  
  
  
  
  # Color
  >Color is the aspect of things that is caused by differing qualities of light being reflected or emitted by them. 
  >To see color, you have to have light. When light shines on an object some colors bounce off the object and others are absorbed by it.
  > Our eyes only see the colors that are bounced off or reflected.
  > and which make our page more meaningfull .

  > There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
XX Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
XX It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
XX CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
XX CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA .


# Text

element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned

indented.



# JPEG vs PNG vs GIF

**JPEG**
> PEG stands for “Joint Photographic Experts Group”. It's a standard image format for containing lossy and compressed image data. Despite the huge reduction in file size JPEG images maintain reasonable image quality .Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.

**PNG**
> PNG stands for “Portable Graphics Format”. ... This lossless data compression format was created to replace the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF). PNG file format is an open format with no copyright limitations. Like GIF images, PNG also have the ability to display transparent backgrounds.No data is lost during compression and no compression artefacts are introduced in the image. For this reason, a PNG image would retain higher quality than an image than JPEG and would look a lot sharper, it would also occupy more space on the disk

> deferint between JPEG vs PNG .


**GIF**
> Last but not least, we have GIFs (Graphics Interchange Format). GIFs are also lossless and support transparency, much like PNGs. However, unlike the PNG, they do support animation across all browsers. GIFs use 8-bit color and thus only have a range of 256 colors. They are usually just used for animations and very simple images or logos.
