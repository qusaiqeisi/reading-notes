## Solve Programming Problems
1. measure twice and cut once:
> mean you have to think in what you do and start excuting one time .
2. Solve the problem manually .
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

## Point to success .
> to make more success on your life and in job life you have to focus in work and spend time in what make your skill more good . and how you are think that your are worth .


## Maind Thinking for a Programmer .

old way 
> 1. Try a solution.
> 2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
> 3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

new way .
> is to have a framework .
*that will make your time more efficient*.

1. Understand : what is the problem 
2. Plan : how we can solve it 
3. Divide : to make it more semple 
4. Stuck : re do it again .

## 5 Whys :


> Five whys (or 5 whys) is an iterative interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem. The primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question "Why?". Each answer forms the basis of the next question.


> Five whys (5 whys) is a problem-solving method that explores the underlying cause-and-effect of particular problems. The primary goal is to determine the root cause of a defect or a problem by successively asking the question “Why?”.

> Once a cause is identified, its root cause is explored with the 5 Whys technique. By simply asking 'why' multiple times, the cause of the previous cause is uncovered, and added to the diagram. The process stops once a suitable root cause has been identified and the same process is then applied to the next cause.
