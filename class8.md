# APIs
> API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.

## REST 
> REST stands for Representational State Transfer. (It is sometimes spelled "ReST".) It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- and in virtually all cases, the HTTP protocol is used. REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications.

## REST in API 
> REST or RESTful API design (Representational State Transfer) is designed to take advantage of existing protocols. While REST can be used over nearly any protocol, it usually takes advantage of HTTP when used for Web APIs. ... REST API Design was defined by Dr. Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctorate dissertation .


## an identifer of a resource
> Resources whose location, grade, quality, and quantity are known or estimated from specific geologic evidence. Identified resources include economic, marginally economic, and subeconomic components.

## HTTP verbs
>  The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations, respectively.

## URL
> A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a unique sequence of characters that identifies a logical or physical resource used by web technologies ,The URI comprises: A non-empty scheme component followed by a colon ( : ), consisting of a sequence of characters beginning with a letter and followed by any combination of letters, digits, plus ( + ), period ( . ), or hyphen ( - ).
A URI — short for “Uniform Resource Identifier” — is a sequence of characters that distinguishes one resource from another. For example, foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose is a URI containing a scheme name, authority, path, query and fragment. A URI does not need to contain all these components.![](https://media.cheggcdn.com/media/31a/31ae6d56-1ae1-454c-9a0f-b15426a09d01/phpUPIITb.png)


## Chatty API
> Chatty API is one that requires consumer to make tremendous (subjective matter) amount of distinct API calls to get needed information about a resource. George Reese has defined chatty API as any API that requires consumer to do more than a single call to perform a single, common operation.
> Good REST APIs: are well-documented and reliable. use HTTP verbs as Fielding originally defined. support X-HTTP-METHOD-Override to accommodate picky proxies.

## GET 
> successful : This means the request was successful and the server created a new resource. ... This means the server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content. Unlike a 204 response, this response requires that the requester reset the document view.

## POST 
> This means the request was successful and the server created a new resource. ... This means the server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content. Unlike a 204 response, this response requires that the requester reset the document view.
 
## DELETE 
> Responses. If a DELETE method is successfully applied, there are several response status codes possible: A 202 ( Accepted ) status code if the action will likely succeed but has not yet been enacted. A 204 ( No Content ) status code if the action has been enacted and no further information is to be supplied.
