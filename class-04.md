# linke 
> Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another — enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.

> the linke between tow a tag is the linke to go there by adding herf to it . and the discribtion of it will between start tage and closed tage .

**Linking to Other Sites**
![othersiste](https://www.wikitechy.com/step-by-step-html-tutorials/img/html-images/code-explanation-link-tag-in-html.png) 
we see that a tage can be in oreder and unorder list as out source linke When you link to a different
website, the value of the href
attribute will be the full web
address for the site, which is
known as an absolute URL.

**Opening Links in a New Window**
> One of the most common
reasons a web page author
might want a link to be opened
in a new window is if it points to
another website. In such cases,
they hope the user will return
to the window containing their
site after finishing looking at the
other one.

# Layout
> HTML layouts provide a way to arrange web pages in well-mannered, well-structured, and in responsive form or we can say that HTML layout specifies a way in which the web pages can be arranged. Web-page layout works with arrangement of visual elements of an HTML document.



### HTML Layout Elements
* header - Defines a header for a document or a section.
* nav - Defines a set of navigation links.
 * section - Defines a section in a document.
* article - Defines an independent, self-contained content.
* aside - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)

![layout](https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_sem_elements.gif)
> CSS layout techniques allow us to define the placement of elements on a web page, that is to control where they are positioned with respect to their default position as per normal flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window.
 
 **Normal Flow**
 > Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout. The flow is essentially a set of things that are all working together and know about each other in your layout. Once something is taken out of flow it works independently

  # Functions, Methods, and Objects of javascript.
  > JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties
   ### FUNCTION
   > A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables)
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task .

![function](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/s3.studytonight.com/tutorials/uploads/pictures/1587882057-1.png)
 
 > As already mentioned, functions can be parameterized and non-parameterized which means they may or may not take any input. A function that does not take any parameters/inputs is known as non-parametrized function.

 ### what is VARIABLE scop , MEMORY , VARIABLES WORK ?
 > variable : ita name for everything that we use and we called it by the function var .

**VARIABLE scop**
> he scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes.

Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.
Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.
Within the body of a function, a local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. If you declare a local variable or function parameter with the same name as a global variable, you effectively hide the global variable.

#  Pair Programming
> air programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. which make them more efficiency 
pir programming is life style that make your life more easy in programming and it will be more accurat by save time and jobe interviwe and more and more .
