# Graphs :

### Graph :

- A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

### Vertex :

- or node means the data object that can has other adjacent vertices or not.a vertex (plural vertices) or node is the fundamental unit of which graphs are formed.

### Edge :

- the connection between two nodes.

### Degree :

- number of edges that the node has.

### Neighber :

- the connected nodes to the node.

## Directed & unDirected Graph

- Directed or called Digraph : that the edge has a direction and one of two connected nodes has the other, and the other one hasn't. (uni-directional)

- unDirected : both of them has the other node. (bi-directional)

## complete graph :

- when each node connected to all other nodes.

## connected :

- when no node doesn't has least one edge or doesn't connected at least to one node.

## Dusconnected graph :

- when one or more nodes doesn't has any edge or node.

## directed acyclic graph is also called a DAG :

- when no cycle happen in the graph.

## Cyclic Graphs :

- when starts with node and returns to the same node.

## Weighted Graphs :

- A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.

### We represent graphs through:

    - Adjacency Matrix : by two dimensional array.
    - Adjacency List : it is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

- in weighted graphs you must include both the weight and the name of the adjacent vertex.

## Traversals :

- will do traversals in graph with breadth first and depth first methods.

## Real applications of graphs :

#### 1. GPS and Mapping

#### 2. Driving Directions

#### 3. Social Networks

#### 4. Airline Traffic

#### 5. Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
