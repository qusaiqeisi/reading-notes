# Review, Research, and Discussion

**What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”**

### Cookies :

- work with client and server sides.
- primary used for reading server-side.
- you can set expiration date of your data.
- Cookies give you a limit of 4096 bytes/cookie.
- you can only store strings.
- data are sending back and forth with every HTTP request.

### Local storage :

- works with client side only.
- no expiration date available.
- Local Storage is as big as 5MB per domain.
- you can store strings, Javascript primitives, and objects.
- data are not sending back and forth with every HTTP request (keeps the data on client side).

**Explain 3rd party cookies.**

- Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, you can have a "Like" button on your website which will store a cookie on a visitor's computer, that cookie can later be accessed by Facebook to identify visitors and see which websites they visited. Such a cookie is considered to be a 3rd party cookie.

**How do pixel tags work?**

- A tracking pixel is an HTML code snippet which is loaded when a user visits a website or opens an email. It is useful for tracking user behavior and conversions. With a tracking pixel, advertisers can acquire data for online marketing, web analysis or email marketing. With log file analysis, long data evaluation or using appropriate analytical tools, this data can be used for different purposes, for example retargeting.

### 4. conditional rendering : Conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false.
