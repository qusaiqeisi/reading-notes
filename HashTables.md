# Hashtables :

### What is a Hashtable?

> In computing, a hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found . 

  >  hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched. By using a good hash function, hashing can work well.

 ### What is a hash data structure? 

 > Hashing in the data structure is a technique of mapping a large chunk of data into small tables using a hashing function. It is also known as the message digest function. It is a technique that uniquely identifies a specific item from a collection of similar items


 ### Why do we use them?

- Hold unique values
- Dictionary
- Library

### What Are they?

> The basic idea of a hashtable is the ability to store the key into this data structure, and quickly retrieve the value. This is done through what we call a hash. A hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.

### Hash function ? 

   >A hash function is a function that takes a set of inputs of any arbitrary size and fits them into a table or other data structure that contains fixed-size elements. ... The table or data structure generated is usually called a hash table.

   ### Hash maps do this to store values?:
   > HashMap is a Map based collection class that is used for storing Key & value pairs, it is denoted as HashMap<Key, Value> or HashMap<K, V>. This class makes no guarantees as to the order of the map. It is similar to the Hashtable class except that it is unsynchronized and permits nulls(null values and null key)

   > - accept a key
> - calculate the hash of the key
> - use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
> - store the key with the value by appending both to  the end of a linked list
> - Hash maps do this to read value .
