**what do we mean by verison control** ? 

verison control, also called source control, allows you to manage changes to files over time, storing these modifications in a database.
You can use version control to version code, binary files, and digital assets.
- Version control systems allow multiple developers, designers, and team members to work together on the same project. 
-  VCS, these systems are critical to ensure everyone has access to the latest code.
-   As development gets more complex,  there's a bigger need to manage multiple versions of entire products

## type of verison control .
- Local Version Control

 VCS :`vreison control system` the old one to use .
 
 - Centralized Version Control 
 
 CVCS : `Centralized Version Control System `

- Distributed Version Control
type of version control where the complete codebase ‚Äî including its full version history ‚Äî is mirrored on every developer's computer
DVCS : `Distributed Version Control systems` 

 
  # git 
 > is the new verison of control that the devloper devlop it to make the programering much esaer and more faster 
  with highly safty process .
  
  ** how git is work **
 the intention of creating a DVCS with a workflow design similar to that of BitKeeper, which was also fast, 
 Git allowed for non-linear development via multiple branches, could support large projects, possessed
 strong mechanisms preventing corruption, and had a simple design
 
 
 ## git installation 
 you can install it in both `Mac OS X`  `Windows`

# how git work ?

![git](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/default/tutorials/d-learn-workings-git/images/image003.png)

git work dependes on some ordaer and demand from te devloper or group .
***so its contan***
- Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
- Index: The area used for staging
- Head: Points to the most recent commit
  
  so the mean important thing about git is that it can save by `Tracked`and `Untracked` . 
  so you can committ all the change for new and old file and you can control the changes .
  
  # some of git command
  
| Check File Status| $ git status |
| Single File | git add filenam |
| git status | List all new or modified files |
| git diff | Show file differences that haven't been staged |


# Git Life Cycle

Files in a Git project have various stages like Creation, Modification, Refactoring, and Deletion and so on. Irrespective 
of whether this project is tracked by Git or not, these phases are still prevalent. However when a project is under Git 
version control system, they are present in
three major Git states in addition to these basic ones 
- Working directory
- Staging area
- Git directory
