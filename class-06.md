# Object Literals in javascript .
> An object literal is an Object and an object . You can define the type for an object literal with type or interface . It is a quick way to have data in a structure that is typed. The object literal inherits from Object .Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object , variables and functions take on new names.

> An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.


  
# Document Object Model

  >The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
![DOM](https://www.guru99.com/images/JavaScript/javascript8_1.png)

**THE DOCUMENT NODE**
> Above, you can see the HTML code for a shopping
list, and on the right hand page is its DOM tree.
Every element, attribute, and piece of text in the
HTML is represented by its own DOM node.
At the top of the tree a document node is added.



**ELEMENT NODES**
> access the DOM tree, you start by looking for
elements. Once you find the element you want, then
you can access its text and attribute nodes if you
want to. This is why you start by learning methods
that allow you to access element nodes, before
learning to access and alter text or attributes.

**WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE**

1. ACCESS THE ELEMENTS 
> The terms elements and element nodes are used interchangeably
but when people say the DOM is working with an element,
it is actually working with a node that represents that element. and you can selected INDIVIDUAL
ELEMENT NODE by id or MULTIPLE ELEMENTS by class . 
 


 **WORK WITH THOSE ELEMENTS**
 > The text inside any element is stored inside a textnode. To access the text node above:
1. Select the <l i >element
2. Use the fi rstChi l d property
to get the text node
3. Use the text node's only
property (nodeVa l ue) to get
the text from the element

**The following is a brief list of common APIs in web and XML page scripting using the DOM.**
* document.querySelector(selector)
* document.querySelectorAll(name)
* document.createElement(name)
* parentNode.appendChild(node)
* element.innerHTML
* element.style.left
* element.setAttribute()
* element.getAttribute()
* element.addEventListener()
* window.content
* GlobalEventHandlers/onload
* window.scrollTo()

> A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript. so by following the preives tage we can make change . 
![dom](https://info340.github.io/img/html/dom-tree.jpg)

1. Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree
2. An element node can contain multiple text nodes and
child elements that are siblings of each other.
3. Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
node, it will always return a Nadel i st.
From an element node, you can access and update its
content using properties such as textContent and
i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques
4. You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes .



# problem domian 
> A problem domain is simply looking at only the topics of an individual's interest, and excluding everything else. For example, when developing a system to measure good practice in medicine, carpet drawings at hospitals would not be included in the problem domain.

**It is a process that the programmer performs to investigate all the delays and shortcuts that the program contains, and then examines and tests them in whether they work or not, and it is a difficult process that needs a lot of time and effort**
